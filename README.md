# Implementation of a Blackjack playing agent
The goal of this project is the development of an agent capable of playing the game of Blackjack with a positive net return (i.e. "beat the house") using reinforcement learning.
## Limited action space
In this setting the action space is limited to the binary action space {hit, stand}.
## Full action space
In this setting the action space is expanded to the full action space {hit, stand, split, double, insurance}.
